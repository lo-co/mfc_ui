# MFC User Interface

The work in this repository is intended to be a user interface developed in [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) for operating and viewing output from [Alicat mass flow controllers and meters](http://www.alicat.com/).  The application will utilize the [Boost C++ libraries](http://www.boost.org/) in order to make this as portable as possible.
